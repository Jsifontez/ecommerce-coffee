## Code of conduct

FCC VE as a learning community is open to all the people who is interested in
learning new skills and make friends on the way. We believe in learning as a
language and tool to connect with others regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, political
orientation, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We strongly recommend read the [code of conduct file](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
located on the repository root, If you need a guide and examples of what is the
expected behaviour collaborating on this community or if you feel something is
not including you in some way or if something is making you feel uncomfortable
you will find on that document how to report that to us.

## Motivation

Learn to build a simple e-commerce solution from zero and getting experience,
working as team.

Give the opportunity to others to participate in a collaborative project and
let them share with more experienced people before getting a job as programmers.

Also is a good opportunity to explore new technologies and propose the use of
them to others.

## Environment setting and test

### Setting the environment

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to trigger some checks before push
commits to branches this is necessary in order to maintain a good code quality.

Above you have the links to pre-commit official page where is include the
installing/download section for your system.

Once you have installed pre-commit run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Testing the files

## How to submit changes

After you install the required tools to test your submissions you will need to
do the following before posting a new pull request:

1. Create a new branch of `develop`
2. Identify what kind of change you will commit and prefix your branch name with:
  * feature/feature-name
  * fix/bug-name
  * refactor/refactor-name
  * chore/chore-name (used for configs and others)
3. Make some changes on your branch and commit them.
4. Check all the pre-commit passes.
5. Create a new pull request from your branch to develop
6. Complete the pull request template and ask others for review and test.

### Using the issue templates

Issue templates is a tool github offers to make the issues more structured for
the reviewers team. We have made some basic templates to post issues and you
must use them in order to request a change on this repository as collaborator.
